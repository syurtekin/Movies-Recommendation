# Movies-Recommendation

Recommender system is an information filtering system that aims to predict the amount of evaluation or preference a user will give to an item.

4 type of recommender system are very popular, these are:

Simple Recommender System
Association Rule Learning
Content Based Filtering
Collaborative Filtering
  User-based
  Item-based
  Model-based
  
In this study, I am going to analyze that Collaborative Filtering with item based and user based model.

Item-based : Suggestions are made based on the similarity of the films, items, etc.

User-based : is a technique used to predict the items that a user might like on the basis of ratings given to that item by the other users who have similar taste with that of the target user.
